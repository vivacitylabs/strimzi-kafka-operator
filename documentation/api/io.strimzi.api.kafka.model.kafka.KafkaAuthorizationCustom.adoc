To use custom authorization in Strimzi, you can configure your own `Authorizer` plugin to define Access Control Lists (ACLs).

ACLs allow you to define which users have access to which resources at a granular level.

Configure the `Kafka` custom resource to use custom authorization.
Set the `type` property in the `authorization` section to the value `custom`, and configure a list of super users.

IMPORTANT: The custom authorizer must implement the `org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer` interface, and support configuration of super users using the `super.users` configuration property.

[id='property-custom-authorization-authorizerclass-{context}']
= `authorizerClass`

(Required) Java class that implements the `org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer` interface to support custom ACLs.

[id='property-custom-authorization-superusers-{context}']
= `superUsers`
A list of user principals treated as super users, so that they are always allowed without querying ACL rules.

NOTE: The `super.user` configuration option in the `config` property in `Kafka.spec.kafka` is ignored.
Designate super users in the `authorization` property instead.
For more information, see xref:type-KafkaClusterSpec-reference[Kafka broker configuration].

= Additional configuration options

You can add additional configuration for initializing the custom authorizer using `Kafka.spec.kafka.config`.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    authorization:
      type: custom
      authorizerClass: io.mycompany.CustomAuthorizer
      superUsers:
        - CN=client_1
        - user_2
        - CN=client_3
    # ...
    config:
      authorization.custom.property1=value1
      authorization.custom.property2=value2
    # ...

= Adding custom authorizer JAR files to the container image

In addition to the `Kafka` custom resource configuration, the JAR files containing the custom authorizer class along with its dependencies must be available on the classpath of the Kafka broker.

You can add them by building Strimzi from the source-code.
The Strimzi build process provides a mechanism to add custom third-party libraries to the generated Kafka broker container image by adding them as dependencies in the `pom.xml` file under the `docker-images/artifacts/kafka-thirdparty-libs` directory.
The directory contains different folders for different Kafka versions. Choose the appropriate folder.
Before modifying the `pom.xml` file, the third-party library must be available in a Maven repository, and that Maven repository must be accessible to the Strimzi build process.

Alternatively, you can add the JARs to an existing Strimzi container image:

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
FROM {DockerKafka}
USER root:root
COPY ./_my-authorizer_/ /opt/kafka/libs/
USER {DockerImageUser}

= Using custom authorizers with OAuth authentication

When using `oauth` authentication with a `groupsClaim` configuration to extract user group information from JWT tokens, group information can be used in custom authorization calls.
Groups are accessible through the `OAuthKafkaPrincipal` object during custom authorization calls, as follows:

[source, subs="attributes+"]
----
    public List<AuthorizationResult> authorize(AuthorizableRequestContext requestContext, List<Action> actions) {

        KafkaPrincipal principal = requestContext.principal();
        if (principal instanceof OAuthKafkaPrincipal) {
            OAuthKafkaPrincipal p = (OAuthKafkaPrincipal) principal;

            for (String group: p.getGroups()) {
                System.out.println("Group: " + group);
            }
        }
    }
