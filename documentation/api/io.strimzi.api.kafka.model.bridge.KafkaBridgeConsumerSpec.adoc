Configures consumer options for the Kafka Bridge as keys.

The values can be one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

*Exceptions*

You can specify and configure the options listed in the {ApacheKafkaConsumerConfig}.

However, Strimzi takes care of configuring and managing options related to the following, which cannot be changed:

* Kafka cluster bootstrap address
* Security (encryption, authentication, and authorization)
* Consumer group identifier

Properties with the following prefixes cannot be set:

* `bootstrap.servers`
* `group.id`
* `sasl.`
* `security.`
* `ssl.` 

If the `config` property contains an option that cannot be changed, it is disregarded, and a warning message is logged to the Cluster Operator log file.
All other supported options are forwarded to Kafka Bridge, including the following exceptions to the options configured by Strimzi:

* Any `ssl` configuration for xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[supported TLS versions and cipher suites]

[id='property-kafka-bridge-consumer-enabled-config-{context}']
= `enabled`

Enablement of the consumer can be controlled by setting the `enabled` field to `true` or `false`. Default is `true`.

[id='property-kafka-bridge-consumer-timeout-config-{context}']
= `timeoutSeconds`

The timeout for deleting inactive consumers can be configured using `timeoutSeconds`, by default it is not enabled.

.Example Kafka Bridge consumer configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaBridgeApiVersion}
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: my-bridge
spec:
  # ...
  consumer:
    enabled: true
    timeoutSeconds: 60
    config:
      auto.offset.reset: earliest
      enable.auto.commit: true
    # ...
----

IMPORTANT: The Cluster Operator does not validate keys or values in the `config` object.
If an invalid configuration is provided, the Kafka Bridge deployment might not start or might become unstable.
In this case, fix the configuration so that the Cluster Operator can roll out the new configuration to all Kafka Bridge nodes.
