= Configuring user (client-side) security mechanisms

[role="_abstract"]
When configuring security mechanisms in clients, the clients are represented as users.
Use the `KafkaUser` resource to configure the authentication, authorization, and access rights for Kafka clients.

Authentication permits user access, and authorization constrains user access to permissible actions.
You can also create _super users_ that have unconstrained access to Kafka brokers.

The authentication and authorization mechanisms must match the xref:proc-securing-kafka-{context}[specification for the listener used to access the Kafka brokers].

For more information on configuring a `KafkaUser` resource to access Kafka brokers securely, see xref:setup-external-clients-str[].
