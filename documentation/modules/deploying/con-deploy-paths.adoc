= Basic deployment path 

[role="_abstract"]
You can set up a deployment where Strimzi manages a single Kafka cluster in the same namespace.
You might use this configuration for development or testing. 
Or you can use Strimzi in a production environment to manage a number of Kafka clusters in different namespaces. 

The basic deployment path is as follows:

. xref:downloads-{context}[Download the release artifacts] 
. Create a Kubernetes namespace in which to deploy the Cluster Operator
. xref:cluster-operator-{context}[Deploy the Cluster Operator]
.. Update the `install/cluster-operator` files to use the namespace created for the Cluster Operator 
.. Install the Cluster Operator to watch one, multiple, or all namespaces
. xref:kafka-cluster-{context}[Create a Kafka cluster]

After which, you can deploy other Kafka components and set up monitoring of your deployment.
