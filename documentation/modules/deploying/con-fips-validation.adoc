Strimzi is designed to use FIPS-validated cryptographic libraries for secure communication in a FIPS-enabled Kubernetes cluster.
However, it's important to note that while Strimzi can leverage these libraries in a FIPS environment, the underlying Universal Base Images (UBI) used in Strimzi deployments may not inherently include NIST-validated binaries. 
This means that while Strimzi can leverage cryptographic libraries for FIPS, the specific binaries within the Strimzi container images might not have undergone NIST validation.
