= Setting throughput and storage limits on brokers

[role="_abstract"]
Use the _Kafka Static Quota_ plugin to set throughput and storage limits on brokers in your Kafka cluster.
You enable the plugin and set limits by configuring the `quotas` section of the `Kafka` resource.
You can set a byte-rate threshold and storage quotas to put limits on the clients interacting with your brokers.

NOTE: Only one quota plugin can be used in Kafka. 
By enabling this plugin, the built-in Kafka quotas plugin is automatically disabled.
This means that you won't see per-client quota metrics, but only aggregated quota metrics.

You can set byte-rate thresholds for producer and consumer bandwidth.
The total limit is distributed across all clients accessing the broker.
For example, you can set a byte-rate threshold of 40 MBps for producers.
If two producers are running, they are each limited to a throughput of 20 MBps.

Storage quotas enforce the throttling of Kafka producers based on Kafka disk storage utilization when it reaches the specified limit.
You can specify the limit in bytes or percentage of available disk space.
The limit applies to every disk individually.
It prevents disks filling up too quickly and exceeding their capacity.
Full disks can lead to issues that are hard to rectify.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator that manages the Kafka cluster is running.

.Procedure

. Add the plugin configuration to the `quotas` section of the `Kafka` resource.
+
The plugin configuration is shown in this example configuration.

.Example Kafka Static Quota plugin configuration
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    quotas:
      type: strimzi
      producerByteRate: 1000000 # <1>
      consumerByteRate: 1000000 # <2>
      minAvailableBytesPerVolume: 500000000000 # <3>
      excludedPrincipals: # <4>
        - my-user
----
<1> Sets the producer byte-rate threshold. 1 MBps in this example.
<2> Sets the consumer byte-rate threshold. 1 MBps in this example.
<3> Sets the available bytes limit for storage. 500 GB in this example.
<4> Sets the list of excluded users that are removed from the quota. `my-user` in this example.

. Apply the changes to the `Kafka` configuration.

NOTE: `minAvailableBytesPerVolume` and `minAvailableRatioPerVolume` are mutually exclusive.
This means that only one of these parameters should be configured.
