= Lock acquisition warnings for cluster operations

[role="_abstract"]
The Cluster Operator ensures that only one operation runs at a time for each cluster by using locks. 
If another operation attempts to start while a lock is held, it waits until the current operation completes.

Operations such as cluster creation, rolling updates, scaling down, and scaling up are managed by the Cluster Operator.

If acquiring a lock takes longer than the configured timeout (`STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`), a DEBUG message is logged:

.Example DEBUG message for lock acquisition
[source,shell]
----
DEBUG AbstractOperator:406 - Reconciliation #55(timer) Kafka(myproject/my-cluster): Failed to acquire lock lock::myproject::Kafka::my-cluster within 10000ms.
----

Timed-out operations are retried during the next periodic reconciliation in intervals defined by `STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS` (by default 120 seconds).

If an INFO message continues to appear with the same same reconciliation number, it might indicate a lock release error:

.Example INFO message for reconciliation
[source,shell]
----
INFO  AbstractOperator:399 - Reconciliation #1(watch) Kafka(myproject/my-cluster): Reconciliation is in progress
----

Restarting the Cluster Operator can resolve such issues.
